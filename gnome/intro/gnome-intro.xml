  <title>Introduction to GNOME</title>

  <para>This chapter presents the instructions to install a complete
  GNOME-&gnome-minor14; desktop environment. The order of
  the installed packages follows the build order defined by the GNOME
  development team and has been thoroughly tested by the BLFS team.
  You need to be building GNOME-&gnome-minor14; on top of a system
  running <application>Systemd</application>.
  </para>

  <para>The installation of GNOME-&gnome-minor14; is a
  large undertaking and one we would like to see you complete with the least
  amount of stress.</para>

  <para>To install GNOME as your desktop of choice, it is recommended that you
  install using <option>--prefix=/usr</option>.</para>

  <para>If your system was completely built per LFS and BLFS instructions,
  you have a very good chance of using
  GNOME-&gnome-minor14; after your first installation. If
  you are a typical LFS user, you have made modifications to the instructions
  along the way knowing that you have to take those modifications into account
  on future installations. You should have no problems integrating
  GNOME-&gnome-minor14; into your unique setup, but you
  will have to install well over 50 packages before you can run GNOME through
  any testing (assuming your windowing system is preinstalled and tested). You
  should anticipate that you will be rebuilding GNOME at least once to make
  adjustments for your setup.</para>
