  <title>NFS Utilities-&nfs-utils-version; Client</title>

  <para>The NFS Utilities package provides NFS server functionality as well
  as client software such as <command>mount.nfs</command> or <command>umount.nfs</command>.
  If you want to install it, the instructions can be
  found in Chapter 19 &ndash; <xref linkend="nfs-utils"/>.  Note that if you only
  want to use the client, you do <emphasis>not</emphasis> need to run the server
  and so do not need the startup script and links.  In accordance with good
  practice, only run the server if you actually need it (and if you don't know
  whether you need it or not, it's likely that you don't!).</para>
